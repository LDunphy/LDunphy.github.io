    <!-- Chosen Palette: Brilliant Blues -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a hybrid infographic and interactive toolkit. It begins with a high-level infographic process flow, visually summarizing the four key stages of a software project. This provides an immediate, digestible overview. Below this, a tab-based navigation allows students to delve into each of the four syllabus sections. This structure was chosen to provide a compelling visual entry point (the infographic) while maintaining the logical, syllabus-aligned framework necessary for effective HSC revision. This hybrid approach tells a story from a high-level overview to in-depth detail. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Source Info: NESA Syllabus for Software Project -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz/Method: An HTML/CSS Flow Chart visually represents the 4-stage process. Justification: As the source material is a curriculum structure, not numerical data, a process diagram is the most effective visualization. It clearly organizes the learning path for students. For detailed content, interactive quizzes, matching games, and fill-in-the-blanks are used instead of charts to directly support exam revision and test knowledge recall, which is more appropriate for this educational context. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all interactivity. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
